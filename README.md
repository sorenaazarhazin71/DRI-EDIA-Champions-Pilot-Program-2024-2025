# DRI-EDIA-Champions-Pilot-Program-2024-2025

Project title: Introducing potential opportunities in applying DRI for research and building professional skills for persons living with visible and invisible disabilities

Summary: I aim to create opportunities for individuals with disabilities to engage in cutting-edge research and develop valuable professional skills.


Vision and Mission:

●	Vision: Using opinions and experiences to ensure that DRA adopts and implements an Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (EDIA) approach.

●	Mission: Enhancing accessibility in DRI tools and creating more equitable opportunities for researchers with disabilities.

About: As a person with congenital profound sensorineural hearing loss who uses closed captioning and subtitles in order to better speech comprehension, I think improved knowledge about and access to DRI can mitigate these barriers in several ways for researchers with disability.

Roadmap & Milestones:

●	Goals: Organizing a virtual event, establishing an association in DRA, and reviewing the training resources in DRI with an EDIA approach.

●	Outcomes: An internal association inside DRA for persons with disability and Revised training materials with an EDIA approach.
